# Vegetable_Ordering_app

This project is a web-based application designed to simplify the bulk ordering of fruits and vegetables. The platform allows buyers to browse a catalogue of fresh fruits and vegetables with images, prices, and details, and place bulk orders by providing basic delivery information. After placing an order, buyers can track the order status using a unique order ID.

The application also includes an admin panel where administrators can view all placed orders and update their delivery status from pending to delivered. The system does not require authentication, making it simple and easy to use for demonstration and learning purposes.

The frontend of the application is built using React.js, focusing on a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface that works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices. The backend is developed using Node.js with Express, which provides RESTful APIs for handling products and orders. SQLite is used as the database to store product and order information, ensuring lightweight and efficient data management.

Overall, this project demonstrates end-to-end full-stack development, including frontend design, backend API development, database integration, and responsive UI design.
